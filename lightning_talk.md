I work for SECOORA (South East Coastal Observing Regional Association)

SECOORA is part of IOOS (Integrated Ocean Observing System)

And IOOS is part of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)

In my work I use CSW (Catalog Services for the Web)

That obey the OGC conventions (Open Geospatial Consortium)

Enough with acronyms!

What is IOOS vision?

A fully integrated ocean observing system that enables the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its partners to provide service to the Nation through improved ecosystem and climate understanding; sustained living marine resources; improved public health and safety; reduced impacts of natural hazards and environmental changes; and enhanced support for marine commerce and transportation.
